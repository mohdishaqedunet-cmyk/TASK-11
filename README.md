# TASK-11
This workflow outlines a complete Support Vector Machine (SVM)–based classification process. It begins by loading the dataset and performing exploratory analysis to understand the features and examine the distribution of target labels, which helps identify issues such as class imbalance. Since SVMs are sensitive to feature scales, StandardScaler is applied to normalize the feature values so that each feature contributes equally to the learning process. The data is then split into training and testing sets to ensure that model performance is evaluated on unseen data. A baseline SVM model with a linear kernel is first trained to establish a reference level of performance, followed by an SVM with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to capture potential non-linear relationships and compare accuracy. To further improve the model, GridSearchCV is used to tune the hyperparameters C and gamma through cross-validation, allowing the selection of the best-performing configuration. The optimized model is then evaluated using a confusion matrix and a classification report to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the ROC curve is plotted and the AUC score is calculated to measure the model’s ability to distinguish between classes. Finally, the tuned model pipeline, which includes both the scaler and the SVM classifier, is saved for future reuse and deployment.
